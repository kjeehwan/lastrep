# Suggestions for Improvement:

## 1. Optional vs. Required Fields:

Consider making some fields optional (e.g., nickname or experience level) rather than forcing every user to complete them. While it's important to collect this data, it could be useful to allow users to skip or adjust later.

For example, a user might prefer to stay anonymous at first and come back to fill in the nickname later.

## 2. Immediate Feedback After Goal Selection:

After the user selects a goal, perhaps a quick 1-2 sentence description of that goal could pop up. It helps users feel more confident about their choice, especially if they're not sure what each option entails.

## 3. Progress Indicator:

Consider adding a progress bar or step indicator at the top of each screen (e.g., “Step 3 of 6” or a circular progress indicator). It gives users a sense of how far they’ve come and how much is left.

## 4. Incorporating Visuals/Images:

Adding icons or images related to each goal and experience level (e.g., a dumbbell for "Build Muscle", a treadmill for "Lose Fat") can make the screens more engaging.

Simple illustrations can also make the flow feel more dynamic and less "form-based."

## 5. Welcome Message:

The Welcome Screen can be shortened slightly by keeping the text succinct and straightforward. For example, "Welcome to LastRep" with a tagline like "Your coach and guide to fitness!" can be just as effective, cutting out excess words.

A progressive animation (like a smooth fade-in) on the "Let’s Go" button would make it feel more interactive.

## 6. Skip Option:

It might be useful to have a Skip button at each step, allowing users to proceed without entering information (for cases where they’re in a hurry or prefer to adjust settings later). But keep this option subtle so it doesn’t distract from the flow.

## 7. Instant Plan Preview:

In the Plan Preview screen, rather than just showing the user a static preview, you could allow them to toggle between different plan types or even display a brief message on how this plan will help them. This gives users a sense of control over their plan before finalizing it.
